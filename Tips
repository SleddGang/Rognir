Hey there! Im Naka, i'd like to give some advices if you guys want to turn this out in a content mod.

1- Use Git Bash, i dont know if you are using it already but it is pretty useful to link your mod and develop files with other contributors.

2- Make a license, it prevent others from directly copying and/or stealing your files, that includes codes, sprites and songs. If you are making a open source mod i recommend
the GNU license or MIT license, if you are making it private to devs only then i recommend Creative Commons licenses, there's a lot of licenses that CC distributes, just pick one
you would like to use, it is totally free. Just make a file called LICENSE in your mod repositorie with the icense inside of it.

3- Make partnerships, it is quite important to receive feedback and eventually public, so you can improve your content quality each time more
and more

That's all, i hope i could help. I have been talking to Salted, he told me you might need some other developers when the content mod release, count
me in as a Coder! I know how to make Items, Armor sets, Biomes, Water Styles, Gore, Dusts and im learning UI and AI.
